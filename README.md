> Real-time respiratory illness outbreak detection with AI-powered risk prediction using Apache Kafka streaming and machine learning.

## 🚀 Overview

This system monitors patient data across multiple healthcare facilities and uses **real-time machine learning** to predict outbreak risks before they become critical. Built for hackathons, research, and educational purposes.

### 🔥 Key Features

- **Real-time Data Streaming** with Apache Kafka
- **AI-Powered Outbreak Prediction** using Weka ML library
- **Multi-Hospital Monitoring** across 5+ healthcare facilities
- **Live Learning Algorithm** that adapts to new patterns
- **Risk Scoring System** (0-100% outbreak probability)
- **Memory Optimized** for 4GB RAM systems

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Healthcare Data → Kafka Producer → Kafka Topic → AI Predictor → Risk Alerts
                                                       ↓
                                              Real-time ML Model
                                              (Learns & Adapts)
```

## 🎯 Demo Highlights

- **Live AI Training**: Watch the ML model learn outbreak patterns in real-time
- **Outbreak Simulation**: Generates realistic patient data with epidemic clusters  
- **Risk Predictions**: AI provides 0-100% outbreak probability for each hospital
- **Feature Analysis**: Shows which factors drive predictions (temperature, case velocity, symptoms)
